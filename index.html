                    <h2>1. Pre-requisite</h2>
                    <p>You must familiarize yourself with our AntiCheat to be able to use it better. Official Site: **<a href="https://chronosguard.netlify.app/#home" target="_blank">https://chronosguard.netlify.app/#home</a>**, Official Discord: **<a href="https://discord.gg/sS6B8Cy9" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/sS6B8Cy9</a>**.</p>
                    <h3>Preliminary Information:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Our AntiCheat system is not compatible with the Roblox version for Xbox or consoles (players on these platforms will not be affected).</li>
                        <li>The configuration is simpler compared to other systems, allowing you to start using it quickly.</li>
                        <li>The system uses a "cloud" simulation to process resource-intensive checks, which offloads CPU and memory usage from your server.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="content-box">
                    <h2>2. Configuration and Connection</h2>
                    <p>The configuration of our system is the process of connecting your Roblox game with our service. You will only need to have a Discord account and access to your game's settings in Roblox Studio.</p>
                    <p>You can find more information and instructions on how to set up Discord Webhooks on our homepage **<a href="https://chronosguard.netlify.app" target="_blank">(chronosguard.netlify.app)</a>**.</p>

                <div class="content-box">
                    <h2>3. Evaluation and Requirements</h2>
                    <p>For your game to be able to use our system, it must meet certain requirements. If this is your first time using it, you will have to go through an evaluation process. To begin, open a ticket on our **<a href="https://discord.gg/sS6B8Cy9" target="_blank">Discord server</a>**.</p>
                    <p>Before opening the ticket, use this list to ensure your game meets the minimum requirements for evaluation:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It must have an active community or social network (like a Discord server).</li>
                        <li>Your game must have an active and established player base.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>After submitting the evaluation request, we will take our time to review your server, and a qualified staff member will make a decision.</p>

                    <h2>4. Before Proceeding</h2>
                    <p>If you haven't completed the first step, we recommend you do so now. Although our AntiCheat system is advanced, please note that it might handle certain situations differently from other solutions.</p>

                <div class="content-box">
                    <h2>5. Placing Your Order</h2>
                    <p>When placing your order, make sure to provide valid personal and game information. Otherwise, we will not be able to process your request. Once you have completed the order, notify our staff in the ticket for us to proceed with the next step.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-box">
                    <h2>6. Verification</h2>
                    <p>After you place your order, we will take up to 24 hours to review it. Only one of our administrators can complete this process. Although it is unlikely, we offer a full refund if your order is rejected at this stage (after 1 week it is accepted).</p>

                    <h3>Detections:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>AntiSpeed</li>
                        <li>AntiJump</li>
                        <li>AntiFly</li>
                        <li>AntiTeleport</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Advantages:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> The scripts are independent, which makes them very easy to implement.</li>
                        <li><strong>Low Server Load:</strong> It consumes few resources as the verifications are basic.</li>
                        <li><strong>Easy to Understand:</strong> The logic of each script is simple and does not require advanced knowledge.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>False Positives:</strong> It is prone to banning users due to errors or bugs, as it lacks an advanced verification system.</li>
                        <li><strong>No Monitoring:</strong> You won't receive alerts when a player is banned. You'll have to check the server logs for detections.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="plan-card">

                    <p>This plan is a big leap in quality. It offers more solid protection and better control, ideal for games looking to grow.</p>
                    <h3>Detections:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Includes all from the Basic Plan.</li>
                        <li>AntiNoClip</li>
                        <li>IntegrityCheck (script injection detection).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Advantages:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Modularity:</strong> It uses a central script (AntiCheatCore) that handles all sanctions and notifications, making it easy to add new detections.</li>
                        <li><strong>Discord Monitoring:</strong> It sends detection notifications to a Discord channel, allowing you to stay on top of what's happening in your game.</li>
                        <li><strong>Flexible Sanctions:</strong> You can configure sanctions for players to be kicked, temporarily banned, or permanently banned.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>No Scoring System:</strong> There can still be false positives as players are sanctioned for each individual violation, rather than for a behavioral pattern.</li>
                        <li><strong>No Manual Control:</strong> You cannot manually kick or ban players from within the game.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This is the most complete and professional solution, with an advanced architecture that simulates a cloud system. It's ideal for games with a large player base that need robust and precise protection.</p>
                    <h3>Detections:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Includes all from the Plus Plan.</li>
                        <li>AntiFlood (autoclicker/macro detection).</li>
                        <li>Behavioral Analysis: The system analyzes movement and behavior patterns to detect more sophisticated cheats.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Advantages:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Cloud Simulation:</strong> The "cloud" processes detections in the background, which reduces your server's CPU and memory load.</li>
                        <li><strong>Minimizes False Positives:</strong> The "suspicion score" system only applies a sanction when it is sure the player is cheating, after a prolonged analysis.</li>
                        <li><strong>Total Control:</strong> You have an in-game administration interface to manually sanction players, giving you complete control over your community.</li>
                        <li><strong>Detailed Information:</strong> Discord notifications are more detailed, including the UserID and the reason for the sanction.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Higher Complexity:</strong> The initial setup is more complex due to the "cloud" logic and the administration GUI.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dependency:</strong> The system relies on the AntiCheatCore to function, so an error in that script could affect the entire system.</li>

                    <h1>FAQ</h1>
                    <p>Frequently asked questions about Chronos Guard.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-box">
                    <h2>1. General</h2>
                    <h3>Is this system compatible with my game?</h3>
                    <p>Our system works with all Roblox games, but players on consoles (Xbox) will not be affected by the anti-cheat.</p>
                    <h3>Why is this anti-cheat different from others?</h3>
                    <p>Unlike other systems, ours prioritizes mitigations over direct punishments. It also uses a background analysis system to avoid false positives.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-box">
                    <h2>2. Configuration</h2>
                    <h3>Do I need a special account to use the system?</h3>
                    <p>No. You only need a **<a href="https://discord.com" target="_blank">Discord account</a>** to receive detection notifications.</p>
                    <h3>How do I configure the system in my game?</h3>
                    <p>To use the Plus or Premium plan, you need to enable HTTP requests in your game and paste your Discord webhook URL into the <code>AntiCheatCore</code> script.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-box">
                    <h2>3. Detections and Penalties</h2>
                    <h3>How does it detect cheats?</h3>
                    <p>The basic system uses simple movement checks (speed, height). The Premium plan uses a suspicion points system that accumulates evidence before penalizing, making it more accurate.</p>
                    <h3>Why wasn't a player banned immediately?</h3>
                    <p>To avoid false positives, the Premium system only applies a penalty when it is certain that a player is cheating. Detections that don't require immediate intervention are processed in the "cloud" for a longer, more precise analysis.</p>
                    <h3>What is "Script Injection" detection?</h3>
                    <p>It detects if a player has inserted external scripts in their character's GUI. Our Premium system checks this to prevent bans for legitimate Roblox scripts.</p>

                    <h3>Cheat Detection</h3>
                    <p>Initial detection is done in detection scripts like <code>AntiSpeed</code> or <code>AntiFly</code>.</p>
                    <h3>Suspicion Points System</h3>
                    <p>When suspicious behavior is detected, the script does not immediately ban. Instead, it reports "suspicion points" to the (simulated) "cloud."</p>
                    <h3>"Cloud" Processing</h3>
                    <p>The "cloud" evaluates the player's suspicion points. Only when the player reaches a suspicion threshold does the system apply a penalty. This background processing reduces server load.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Basic Plan:</strong> Detections result in an automatic kick or permanent ban.</li>
                        <li><strong>Plus Plan:</strong> Penalties are more flexible, as you can configure if the sanction is a temporary or permanent ban.</li>
                        <li><strong>Premium Plan:</strong> Administrators can manually manage players using an in-game GUI. They can also mute players for minor offenses.</li>

                        <li><strong>Low Server Impact:</strong> The system processes detections that don't require immediate intervention in the background. This reduces your server's CPU and memory load.</li>
